Foundation Setup & Technical Groundwork

 Women Line AI deleloper


AI Developer: 
Begin researching prompts related to period health and mental wellness. Start building dataset and multilingual NLP structure for symptom clarification.

Description :

This project establishes the foundational setup and technical groundwork for an AI-based application focused on period health and mental wellness. The aim is to research and create effective prompts addressing key concerns in women's health, build an initial dataset for NLP training, and design a multilingual framework that can understand and clarify symptoms in various regional languages.

The goal is to enable accurate, empathetic, and accessible AI responses for users seeking information or support for their menstrual health and mental well-being. This project lays the base for future models, APIs, and integrated solutions under the AI Developer Womenâ€™s Health initiative.


 Features :

Prompt Research Framework :
Designed a research framework to create effective AI prompts focusing on period health and mental wellness topics.

Initial Dataset Creation :
Started building structured datasets covering symptoms, user phrases, and emotional expressions for future NLP model training.

 Multilingual NLP Planning :
Planned and outlined the multilingual structure to support symptom clarification in multiple languages (eg. Hindi, English, Marathi).

Symptom Clarification Logic Draft :
Developed basic logic and data mapping strategies to categorise and clarify user-reported symptoms accurately.

Technical Documentation Setup :
Documented all research, dataset structures, and technical groundwork for smooth future development and team reference


 Technologies Used :

Python 3.10
Natural Language Processing (NLP)
OpenAI GPT APIs
